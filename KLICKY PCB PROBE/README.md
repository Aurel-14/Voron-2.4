# REMIX OF KLICKY PCB PROBE DOCK

This is a remix to ajust the position of the magnet.
In the new version le Magnet is lower. So the Kliky PCB is forced to be posed on his dock

Realese 3.1 : New version with a slide system to keep the pcb horizontal, keep it straight and maintaining it in the dock
