# REMIX OF THE FRONT IDLER TENSIONER FOR VORON 2.4

My remix of the front idler tensioner mod from Ramalama2
https://github.com/Ramalama2/Voron-2-Mods/tree/main/Front_Idlers

Body Part was too fragile :
- The 4 pins on body broken easily
- Body walls were too small. I increased the walls

See differences on the picture below. In bleu the original and in red the imroved model :
