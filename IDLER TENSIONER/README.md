# REMIX OF THE FRONT IDLER TENSIONER FOR VORON 2.4

This is my remix of the front idler tensioner mod from Ramalama2
https://github.com/Ramalama2/Voron-2-Mods/tree/main/Front_Idlers

In my opinion, the body part is too fragile :
- The 4 pins on body broken easily
- Body walls are too small. So I increased the walls

See differences on the picture below. In black the original and in red the improved model :

Below see my Design without the pins. Replaced by 2 shapes in up and down :
