1: Install the OS. Flash it with Raspberry Pi imager or Balena Etcher
 https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB1/re...
  I used https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB1/re...

2: Enter your wifi info in the system.cfg file Remember both the SSID and Password are case sensitive. 

3: Boot up and update. Everything! 
 
 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

4: Install CanBoot (note It's now called katapult )
 (https://github.com/Arksine/katapult) its a heplfull tool for updating firmware later on the EBB
 
 cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/Arksine/katapult

5: Make the katapult bootloader for the EBB

 cd katapult
 make menuconfig

  Enter the information for your EBB. I am using the EBB42 V1.1. Check the information for the you you are using as pins and board can be different. The process is the same though. 

 My version uses the STMG0B1 chip and PB0/PB1 for CAN Communication.
 
 After you input your boards info hit Q then Y to save the config. 
 
 Then run,

 make clean
 make

6: Extract the katapult.bin file with something like winscp 

7: Open STM32 cube Programmer and install the bootloader. 

8: Verify the connection, and copy your UUID for future use.
  
 ~/katapult/scripts/flash_can.py -i can0 -q     

 or

 ~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0

9: make klipper for the M8P

 cd ~/klipper/
 make menuconfig

 [\*] Enable extra low level configuration options
 Micro controller Architecture (STMicroelectronics STM32 )
 Processor model (STM32G0B1 )
 Bootloader offset 8 KiB bootloader)
 Clock Reference (8 MHz crystal)
 Communication interface (USB to CAN bus bridge (USB on PA11/PA12))
 CAN bus interface (CAN bus (on PD12/PD13))
 (500000) CAN bus speed

 make clean
 make

10: Enter DFU mode. Hold BOOT and tap RESET, then let go of BOOT. There will be no notification that it went into DFU mode but it shoud have if you did the sequence.

11: flash the firmware.
 make flash FLASH_DEVICE=0483:df11

12: check the UUID and copy it down.
  ~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0  M8P uuid=ff83f3999642  


13: make klipper firmware for the EBB       
 cd ~/klipper/
 make menuconfig
  input the info for your ebb
 make clean
 make

14: flash the ebb

 python3 ~/katapult/scripts/flash_can.py -i can0 -f ~/klipper/out/klipper.bin -u Put_Your_UUID_Here    EBB uuid=2f31fdebecf0



15: Set up klipper and enjoy

Note: you may need to double check the can0 setup. 
 check can0 setup,
  sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0
   
   this is the settings I use in there:

    allow-hotplug can0
    iface can0 can static
         bitrate 250000
         up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024
  ctrl-x to exit 
  y to confirm the change and enter to save.
